Geometric 3D was not built by me

< HOW TO USE A GEOMETRIC 3D >
    1. Geometric 3D sheet information;
        Geometric 3D uses geometry dash to create 3D levels
        So if tou use this file you create 3D levels more easily
        We created this file for many other users.
    2. How to use a Geometric 3D
        Block slice, Layer, and Multiplier and Result in this Sheet.
        Green Box is Move trigger "Time"
        Layer is more layers
        Slice is main layer and Size of a one block z coordinate.
        and Scale just a "Scale"
        You have to write the seconds inside the green box.
        Last, Result is move triggers in move.
        Probably, you don't create 3D. 
        I'll give you more information next time.
  
  GOOD LUCK!
